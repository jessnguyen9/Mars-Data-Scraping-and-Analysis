# module11-challenge

This repository contains Python scripts to scrape data from Mars websites and analyze the collected data. The project consists of two main parts:

**Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News**

Use web scraping techniques to visit the Mars News website.

Extract the titles and preview text of the latest news articles.

Store the scraping results in Python data structures.

Present the collected data as a list of dictionaries.

**Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data**

Utilize web scraping techniques to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.

Extract weather data in the form of an HTML table.

Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.

Determine the number of months on Mars, the number of Martian days worth of data, find the coldest and warmest months on Mars based on average minimum daily temperature, identify the months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars based on average daily pressure, and estimate the number of terrestrial (Earth) days in a Martian year.

Export the DataFrame to a CSV file for further use.
